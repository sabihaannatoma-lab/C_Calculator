This is a basic calculator project using C language to  demonstrate my understanding of conditional logic,operators , and input/output functions.

## Features
- Basic arithmetic operations (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division)
- Scientific functions:
  - Square Root
  - Power (x^y)
  - Natural Log (ln)
  - Log base 10
  - Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Menu-driven and loop-based
- Input validation for safe calculations

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler:
2. Run the program:

## Purpose
This project was created to practice C programming concepts such as:
- Loops
- Switch-case
