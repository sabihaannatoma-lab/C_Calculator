# 🧮 Scientific Calculator in C

A powerful and user-friendly scientific calculator built using **C programming**. This project demonstrates the use of math libraries, switch-case logic, and infinite loops for continuous calculation.

---

### 🌟 Features
- **Basic Arithmetic:** Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division.
- **Advanced Math:** Square Root ($\sqrt{x}$), Power ($x^y$), Factorial ($x!$).
- **Trigonometry:** Sine, Cosine, Tangent calculation.
- **Logarithms:** Natural Log (ln) and Log10.
- **Continuous Operations:** Stay in the program until you choose to exit.

### 🚀 How to Run
1. Open any C Compiler (like VS Code or an Online GDB).
2. Copy the code from `scientific_calculator.c` in this repo.
3. Paste, Compile, and Run!

### 📊 Project Preview
> **Tech Stack:** Written in C, using the `<math.h>` and `<stdio.h>` libraries for high precision.
